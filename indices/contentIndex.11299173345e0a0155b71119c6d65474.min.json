The new link to the training course is https://usbe.instructure.com/enroll/JKTWLM. This will be updated on the USBE website in the next few weeks. This will allow teachers and staff who have previously taken the course to join and refresh their understanding of Acadience Reading administration rules and procedures before administering in the fall. Remember the refresh course is only for staff that have previously been fully trained and is not thorough enough to be used as an initial training. All prior certificates earned by staff have been saved and can be accessed by sending an email to teresa.mcentire@schools.utah.gov with the full name and email address of the course participant.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-21T16:23:35.557412609Z","tags":null},"/notes/Early-Learning-Plan/22-23-Early-Learning-Plan-Goals":{"title":"22-23 Early Learning Plan Goals","content":"\n## Acadience Reading and Math\n\n### State Growth Goal (1st - 3rd Grades)\n\n- By the end of year benchmark, grades 1-3 will have 60% or more students at or above typical progress in reading.\n\n### District Goals - Kindergarten \n\n- **Reading** - At the middle of year benchmark, 80% of students will score 1+ WWR and increase to 4+ WWR by end of year.\n- **Math** - By May 26, 2023, SJSD will increase the percentage of kindergarten students scoring at or above benchmark on Acadience Math Composite Score from BOY to EOY by 10%\n\n### State Goals - 1st Grade\n\n- **Reading** - By May 26, 2023, SJSD will increase the percentage of first grade students scoring at or above benchmark on Acadience Oral Reading Fluency from middle of year to end of year by 5%.\n- **Math** - By May 26, 2023, SJSD will increase the percentage of first grade students scoring at or above benchmark on Acadience Math Composite Score from beginning of year to end of year by 31%.\n\n### State and District Goals - 2nd Grade\n\n- **Reading (State Goal)** - By May 26, 2023, SJSD will increase the percentage of second grade students scoring at or above benchmark on Acadience Oral Reading Fluency from beginning of year to end of year by 6%.\n- **Math (District Goal)** - By May 26, 2023, SJSD will increase the percentage of second grade students scoring at or above benchmark on Acadience Math Composite from beginning of year to end of year by 31%.\n\n### District Goals - 3rd Grade\n\n- **Reading** - By May 26, 2023, SJSD will increase the percentage of third grade students scoring at or above benchmark on Acadience Oral Reading Fluency from middle of year to end of year by 3%.\n- **Math** - By May 26, 2023, SJSD will increase the percentage of third grade students scoring at or above benchmark on Acadience Math Composite Score from beginning of year to end of year by 10%.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-21T16:23:35.557412609Z","tags":null},"/notes/Early-Learning-Plan/22-23-Early-Learning-Plan-Grant-and-Budget-Links":{"title":"22-23 Early Learning Plan Grant and Budget Links","content":"\nThese links go to Google Docs with various privacy settings to restrict access to the appropriate people.\n\n- [Early Learning Plan Grant Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQuLgTNQORfoXp88G7slBge0n3sTs-e6/edit?usp=sharing\u0026ouid=111759161769359059145\u0026rtpof=true\u0026sd=true)\n- [Early Learning Plan Goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k0d52TVtCihhjWFtexr1vn4V8RVjWgP5KP6NBmWgsWs/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Appropriate Expenditures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avdV6NAkhzPttsImlOSUNnP5L5I4lu2wiEYmWKTBPHk/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Budget Allocations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lu-OZNZqGJiTq_qpma3F0G062xiTWyJHvqraH0NZl1k/edit?usp=sharing)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-21T16:23:35.557412609Z","tags":null},"/notes/Early-Learning-Plan/Early-Learning-Plan":{"title":"Early Learning Plan","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-21T16:23:35.557412609Z","tags":null},"/notes/LETRS/LETRS":{"title":"LETRS","content":"\n- [[notes/LETRS/Midas Registration | Midas Registration]]\n- [[notes/LETRS/Midas Registration for Cohort 1 | Midas Registration for Cohort 1]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-21T16:23:35.557412609Z","tags":null},"/notes/LETRS/Midas-Registration":{"title":"Midas Registration","content":"\nIn order to get a Midas Account, follow the directions [here](https://usbe.midaseducation.com/professional-development/catalog/help) or the copied instructions below:\n\n\u003e Please note that all the information listed in MIDAS is gathered from your CACTUS account.
