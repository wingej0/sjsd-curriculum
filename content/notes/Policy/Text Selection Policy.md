## Considerations for Selecting Texts

Please follow the guidelines set forth in [Board Policy 5310.2](https://go.boarddocs.com/ut/sjsd/Board.nsf/files/CJEP26626B61/$file/5310%20Instruction%20-%20Instructional%20Resources%20-%20Curriculum%20Selection%20r%2009%202022.pdf) when choosing texts.  These guidelines are for the libraries, but crossover to in-class selections:

1. relevance to the state curriculum standards and goals of the school
2. developmental/maturity level of students
3. currency/timeliness and accuracy
4. diversity of ideas and provision of balanced views
5. integration of Native American perspectives
6. artistic quality and literary style
7. reputation and significance of author, producer, and/or publisher
8. legality
9. requests and recommendations of faculty and students

## How to Adopt a New Text

1. Check to see if it is part of the [approved district canon](https://www.livebinders.com/media/get/MTE4MTYwOTg=).  If it is, go ahead and use it.  No other steps are needed.  If not, complete the other steps in this document.
2. Fill out the [Adopt an In-Class Literary Selection Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tyG2BSVAnRWny9X8LVO-R-4keXK7lYoc8os0StiPB_M/edit?usp=sharing).
3. Consult with a professional colleague in their school who will read the selection and add their approval that it follows the guidelines set forth in [H.B. 374 - Sensitive Materials in Schools](https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/HB0374.html) and has literary/educational value for the students in that specific school to the In-Class Literary Selection Form.
4. Give the completed form to the school principal, who will sign off on the selection and *keep the form on file*.
5. Create a Parent Guide that will be sent to parents / guardians that includes a summary of the text, an explanation of literary merit, the objectives and standards being taught, and any potentially objectionable material and how it will be dealt with ([Parent Guide Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygtW7ot39x12tUQ6nRPoQGw5xFQaxQiVZBQ1WS0lffE/edit?usp=sharing)).
6. Selections approved for school use through this process may be added to the district canon by the District Curriculum Team following the process outlined in 5320.2.
